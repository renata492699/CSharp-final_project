# CSharp-FinalProject

My bookshelf is a desktop application. It allows a user to add, edit and delete book records. Each book record has information, such as title, author, reading start and finish, rating, a note and genres. The record can be added to one or more of four categories (read, now reading, favourite and wish), allowing the user to organise the records better. Records also can be filtered by genre.
